# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Responsive web GUI (FastAPI + React/Vite) accessible via `scalo-web` command
- Real-time search progress via Server-Sent Events (SSE) with polling fallback
- Airport autocomplete with search by IATA code, city, or country name
- Itinerary comparison page with cross-search selection, summary strip, and export (JSON/CSV)
- Service layer (`services.py`) shared between CLI and web API
- Progress callback support in `FlightSearcher.search()`
- Multi-stage Docker build serving both CLI and web UI
- Active airports API endpoint integration
- Recent searches (last 3) with one-click form prefill via localStorage
- "Skip cache" checkbox to force fresh results from Ryanair API

### Changed
- Renamed the project to scalo: the repository, the Python package (`scalo`) and the commands (`scalo` and `scalo-web`, formerly `ryanair-search` and `ryanair-web`)
- Default maximum layover raised from 8 to 12 hours, so connections with a long same-day wait (common on low-frequency routes) show up without tweaking the search
- CLI refactored to thin adapter using shared service layer
- Professional `src/` layout with modular package structure
- SQLite-based API response caching with configurable expiry
- Domain exceptions (`APIError`, `CacheError`, `InvalidRouteError`)
- `discover` command to find valid connection airports for a route
- Structured logging (progress to stderr, output to stdout)
- CLI with argparse subcommands (`discover`, `search`)
- JSON and table output formats
- Configurable connection constraints (min/max time, overnight toggle)
- Connections file persistence (`connections.json`)
- Comprehensive test suite (84% coverage)
- Type checking with mypy (strict mode)
- Linting and formatting with ruff
- Pre-commit hooks configuration
- GitHub Actions CI (lint, typecheck, test, Docker build)
- Dockerfile with uv Python base image
- MIT License, README, and CONTRIBUTING guide
- Centralized configuration in `config.py`

### Removed
- Monolithic single-file script (`ryanair_search.py`)

### Fixed
- Search missed every flight on a day except the cheapest one, because Ryanair's fare endpoint returns a single fare per query. Flights are now read from the timetable and priced one by one.
- Total duration and layover length were computed from local clock times, so trips across time zones (Dublin to Seville, say) were off by an hour, and layovers spanning a daylight-saving change were too. Both are now real elapsed time, using each airport's time zone.
- The web UI and its JSON export showed fares like "EUR 20.1", because the API sent prices as raw decimals. Prices now always carry two decimals, as the CLI already printed them.
- With `--allow-overnight`, a first leg on the last day of the search window could never connect to a flight the next morning, because second legs were only fetched up to the end date. They are now fetched one day further when overnight connections are allowed; same-day searches fetch exactly the dates asked for, as before.
